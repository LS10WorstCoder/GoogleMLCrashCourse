1. the test loss in task 2 is significantly smaller than it is in part one
2. d(test|training) = -0.046
3. every weight other than x1 and x2 become significantly smaller and weights of x1 and x2 are reduced and made equal
4. the results show that this model was made less complex with the significant decrease of the weights
